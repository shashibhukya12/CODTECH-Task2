Overview
Task-2 focuses on performing advanced data analysis using SQL by applying powerful query techniques beyond basic SELECT statements. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, patterns, and trends from relational data.

Key Activities
-Prepare or select a dataset (employees, sales, students, etc.) for analysis
-Write Window Function queries to calculate:
  -Rankings (RANK, DENSE_RANK)
  -Running totals / cumulative sums
  -Moving averages
  -Partition-wise aggregates
-Write Subqueries to:
  -Filter data using comparison conditions
  -Retrieve records above/below averages
  -Handle nested query logic
-Use CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to:
  -Structure complex queries
  -Improve readability and reusability
  -Break analysis into logical steps
-Analyze and interpret results to identify patterns or trends
-Prepare output evidence such as query results and screenshots
-Document findings in a short analytical summary/report

Technologies Used
-SQL (Structured Query Language) – core language for writing advanced analytical queries
-RDBMS Platform (any one based on setup):
  -MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server / Oracle
-Database Client / Query Tool:
  -MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin / SQL Server Management Studio / Oracle SQL Developer / Command Line
-Text Editor / IDE (Optional):
  -VS Code / Notepad++ for scripting
-Documentation Tools:
  -MS Word / Google Docs / PDF tool for preparing report and screenshots

Key Insights
-Window Functions allow you to analyze data within partitions, enabling rankings, cumulative totals, and averages without collapsing rows.
-Subqueries help filter or aggregate data in a stepwise manner, making complex conditions easier to handle.
-CTEs (Common Table Expressions) improve query readability, maintainability, and make multi-step analyses structured.
-Advanced SQL techniques enable extraction of meaningful patterns, trends, and insights from datasets.
-Combining these techniques is essential for real-world data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence tasks.
-Practicing these queries develops skills for complex analytics, which are foundational for dashboards, BI reports, and decision-making.
